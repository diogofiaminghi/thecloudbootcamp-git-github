## Description

In this project based on a real-world scenario, I acted as a DevOps Engineer to migrate application and website code from a local repository to remote repositories on GitHub.

My mission was to upload the code stored on my computer to GitHub, and validate the features between the repositories (local and remote) by running some tests of code changes. Besides, to complete the validation process, I had to run a rollback procedure/reverting test.

You will need to have a [AWS Account] (https://aws.amazon.com/).
In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode] (https://code.visualstudio.com/).
